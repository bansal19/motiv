Explore Music Through Emotion
Aiming to surface the underlying way people interact with music, Emotiv Music has developed a method to classify music based off emotion.

The company has three goals:
Bring light to the way we already interact with music. Imagine a program that understands your current mood, and fits music that aligns with it.

Use music as a historical tool. Imagine being able to look back over the last hundred years and seeing how the emotion of music has evolved. Was the world happier during the 60s hippie movement versus the 30s and the Great Depression?

Tool for artists to understand what makes music have the emotion it does. What words have been popular in different genres/time periods. Imagine a rapper who wants to learn the words of popular angry rap songs in the 80s to try to bring the 80s back!

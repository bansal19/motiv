1,Alan Walker,All falls down,"What's the trick? I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through
All the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too

All it takes is that one look you do
And I run right back to you
You cross the line
And it's time to say ""F... you""

What's the point in saying that
When you know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it back
But shit just don't work like that

You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck with you
And that's that

'Cause when it all falls down
Then whatever
When it don't work out
For the better
If it just ain't right
And it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down
When it all falls down

I'll be fine, I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad, but I'll be fine

Why we fight? I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I try staying cold
But you take it personal

All these firing shots
And making ground
It's way too hard to cope
But I still can't let you go

'Cause when it all falls down
Then whatever
When it don't work out
For the better
If it just ain't right
And it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down
When it all falls down

I'll be fine, I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad, but I'll be fine

I'll be fine, fine
(All falls down)
I'll be fine, fine, fine
I fine, fine, fine, fine
(Falling down)
(All falls down)
I'll be fine, fine, fine

I fine, fine, fine, fine
(All falls down)
I'll be fine, fine, fine
I fine, fine, fine, fine
(Falling down)
(All falls down)
I'll be fine, fine, fine
I fine, fine

'Cause when it all falls down
Then whatever
(Then whatever, babe)
When it don't work out
For the better
(For the better)
If it just ain't right
(If it just ain't right,)
And it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down
(When it all, when it all)
When it all falls down

I'll be fine (Fine, fine, fine)
I'll be fine (I'll be fine)
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad

2,Alle Farben & Ilira,Fading,"All I ever wanted was to find you
Find a love I never knew
I can feel the pain inside me fading
While I'm fading into you

Been to Paris, been to Rome
But I never found my home
Till you came and took my hand
Been to deserts and the coast
Couple turns along the road
Then I found you in the end

You lead the way out of the dark
Laying out my cards
In your hands, all of them showing hearts
Seasons changing all the time
But our love's one of a kind
Write our names into the sky

Come on, keep it going
There's so much for us to see
(Whoo hoo, whoo hoo, whoo hoo hoo)
It don't matter where we are
As long as you're with me
(Whoo hoo, whoo hoo)
As long as you're with me

All I ever wanted was to find you
Find a love I never knew
I can feel the pain inside me fading
While I'm fading into you

All I ever wanted was to find you
Find a love I never knew
I can feel the pain inside me fading
While I'm fading into you

City lights passing by
Without you I'm colorblind
Ain't no reason left to hide
Chasing highs day and night
Praying you stay by my side
When you're with me, I'm alright

You lead the way out of the dark
Laying out my cards
In your hands, all of them showing hearts
Never leave, standing still
Put you on a pedestal
Keep you safe and always will

Come on, keep it going
There's so much for us to see
(Whoo hoo, whoo hoo, whoo hoo hoo)

3,Anne-Marie,2002,"I will always remember
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of two thousand and two

We were only eleven
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing ""love is forever and ever""
Well, I guess that was true

Dancing on the hood
In the middle of the woods
Of an old Mustang
Where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs

Now we're under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah, we are all we need
When we're holding each other
I'm taken back to two thousand and two

Dancing on the hood
In the middle of the woods
Of an old Mustang
Where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me

Singing at the top of both our lungs

Ask you once, ask you twice now

You say she's just a friend now
Then why don't we call her?
So you wanna go home with someone
To do all the things you used to do to me
I swear, I know you do

Used to take me out in your fancy car
And make out in the rain
And when I ring you up
Don't know where you are

Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs do you want to drink on?

She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding as shot gun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called, was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh, singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me, you know

Now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night

I walked her home then she took me inside
Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm going to put you in a song that I write
About a Galway girl and a perfect night

And two times you let it slip from your lips
You got too much pride to make any promises
Thinking that we got time and you wanna keep it in

I want you out in the pouring rain
I want you down on your knees
Praying to God that I feel the same
I'm right here baby, so please

Hold me up, tie me down
Cause I never wanna leave your side
I swear to never let you down
And it's been eatin' me alive
You can take me home, you can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up

And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down

Nine lives until you fall down my feet
Don't hide, it's a waste of your energy
You're not shy, so baby, it's useless
So don't try, cause you'll end up losing it

I want you out in the pouring rain
I want you down on your knees
Praying to God that I feel the same
I'm right here baby, so please

Hold me up, tie me down
Cause I never wanna leave your side
I swear to never let you down

You can take me home, you can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up

And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down

So wrap your arms around my chest
And I'll put my hands around your neck
Cause nobody wins this waiting game
You push and you pull, but you should stay
Stay

Hold me up, tie me down
Cause I never wanna leave your side
I swear to never let you down

Oh child, maybe you can fall in love with a husband, or a wife
If you're happy when the road is getting rough
I'll be right there by your side

And I know that I can't pretend that I haven't had my regret
From the memories that I've kept, to the history I forget

Oh, there's one thing I wish he said

Write a paragraph
But then I delete the message
Think 'bout you like a past time
I could cry you a river
Get you baptised or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right

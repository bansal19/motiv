0,0,3 Doors Down,Here Without You,"A hundred days to make me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same

And all the miles that separate
You disappeared and I'm dreaming of your face

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight it's only you and me

The miles just keep rolling
As the people leave and wave to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go

Oho, yeah, yeah

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, girl, it's only you and me

Everything I know
And anywhere I go
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love

And when the last one falls
When it's all said and done
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, girl, it's only you and me, yeah

About myself, I'm sorry

Where nothing ever happened?

Are running out of time

And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever
You and me together, nothing is better

With a note that said, 'I'll love her till I die.'

But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust

Don't play games it'll be dangerous, if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil, spell it backwards I'll show ya

Nobody knows me I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mo'fuckin' hoes

Blood sucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like trying to start over

I got a hole in my heart, like some kind of emotional roller coaster
Something I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions ho it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, wasn't joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova and I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you, right at you

I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't, with you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's

Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you, soon as they do feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking when I stumbled on to you, must have been fate

But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take
Let's cut to the chase, 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me, if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be making a mistake, 'cause I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you, right at you

So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms

Drop to my knees and I'm pleading, I'm trying to stop you from leaving
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm trying to stop you from breathing
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezing
Till I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick

Ain't no possible reason I could think of
To let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears streamed down both of my cheeks, then I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

And I would've did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star, 'cause I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon

You said you wouldn't and you fucking did

Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance

When we know it just don't belong

Could make me feel right, no

When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now's the time to let it slide

And I don't know how I can do without; I just need you now

Whoa-oh-whoa
Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now
I just need you now

Oh, baby, I need you now",-0.10000000149011612,3.9000000953674316
